# Keyboard Config
Repo to manage keyboard configurations. I use...
* a Redox wireless w/ my desktop,
* an XD75 sometimes,
* and will eventually up(down)grade to a 36 key layout.

# Benefits
* No caps lock, I never use that
* Easier access to common keys (back/delete/space/enter/square-brackets are all thumb)
* Media controls, mouse movement, and numpad on another layer for easier use
* Overall leaving the homerow less means faster typing, but also it's just fun to optimize / customize

# To explore
* Shortcuts for window and tab management
* Mutli-tap keys and home-row modifiers
* Even more efficiency and less leaving the home row
